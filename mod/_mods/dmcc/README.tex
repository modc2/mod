\section*{Subject}
Clarification of Business Model --- Mod Protocol FZE (Application Ref: [Pending])

\section{Business Model Overview}

\textbf{Mod Protocol FZE} is a software development and licensing company building \textbf{Mod}, a Layer-0 interoperability and orchestration protocol. The protocol enables developers and AI agents to discover, verify, and compose modular components (``modules'') across blockchains, cloud providers, and AI systems.

All interactions on the protocol occur \textbf{on-chain} and are fully \textbf{non-custodial}. Users interact directly with smart contracts from their own wallets. Mod Protocol FZE does \textbf{not} custody, manage, or control user assets.

\subsection*{L1 Network Operations}

Mod Protocol FZE operates and maintains core components of the Mod Layer-1 blockchain infrastructure, including validator nodes, indexing software, and orchestration services. These operations are \textbf{purely technical} and do not involve handling client funds or providing any regulated virtual asset service.

\textbf{Key Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item The L1 processes module execution and metering through transparent on-chain logic
    \item Mod Protocol FZE operates infrastructure nodes but does \textbf{not} intermediate, route, or control user transfers
    \item All token movements occur directly between users and smart contracts; the company cannot access or move user assets
    \item The company provides software reliability, uptime, and protocol maintenance similar to running blockchain validator or indexing services
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Revenue Model}

\subsubsection*{User Subscription (Credit-Based System)}

Users pay the protocol a subscription fee that expires after one month. This fee serves as credit that the protocol debits when the user utilizes tools requiring resources and operational costs. These tools are operated by the company or third-party providers.

\textbf{Example:} Alice purchases a \$10 monthly subscription. She uses a model that costs \$1 to run. Upon execution, \$1 is debited from her subscription balance, leaving \$9. When her balance is depleted, she may purchase a new subscription.

This credit-based subscription model ensures sustainable resource allocation while preventing platform overuse.

\subsubsection*{Business Licensing}

We engage with businesses and governments seeking to build transparent, privacy-focused AI systems. Our services include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Installation and support of blockchain infrastructure
    \item Mining and AI services deployment
    \item Enterprise solutions for efficient digital service management
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What We Are NOT}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Exchange
    \item Custodian
    \item Broker or dealer
    \item Payment service provider
    \item Lending or borrowing platform
    \item Public token issuer
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What We ARE}
A \textbf{software development, infrastructure, and licensing company} that:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Develops and operates blockchain infrastructure
    \item Maintains the Mod Layer-1 network and module marketplace
    \item Licenses enterprise versions of the software
    \item Earns non-custodial software fees
    \item Does not perform any VARA-regulated VASP activities
\end{itemize}

\section{Target Customers \& Partners}

\subsection*{Primary Customers}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Independent developers (AI agents, dApps, automation systems)
    \item Web3 teams requiring modular infrastructure
    \item Enterprises seeking private/hybrid deployments (Q1 2026)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Partners}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item LLM providers (Universal LLM Router)
    \item Solana, Base, and Ethereum Layer-2 ecosystems
    \item Decentralized GPU networks: Akash, Render, io.net
    \item Auditing firms
\end{itemize}

\section{Important Notes}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Mod Protocol FZE does \textbf{not} custody or manage user funds
    \item No exchange, brokerage, payment processing, or lending functions are performed
    \item MOD token is a utility/governance token; not sold or issued by the DMCC entity
    \item Any future token events will be conducted through \textbf{VARA-licensed entities}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Points for DMCC}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item[$\checkmark$] Mod Protocol FZE is a software and infrastructure operator
    \item[$\checkmark$] Operating the L1 is a technical activity, not a regulated financial service
    \item[$\checkmark$] No custody, no exchange, no transfer intermediation
    \item[$\checkmark$] All protocol fees are non-custodial and executed on-chain
    \item[$\checkmark$] MOD token is utility-only and handled outside the DMCC entity
\end{itemize}
