# BlocTime Protocol: One-Page Overview

## What is BlocTime?

BlocTime is a revolutionary protocol that lets you **earn passive income from a thriving marketplace** - simply by locking up your tokens. Think of it as a savings account that pays you dividends from real business activity, not from printing new money.

## The Simple Idea

### For Token Holders (Stakers)
1. **Lock your tokens** for a period of time (measured in blockchain blocks)
2. **Receive BlocTime tokens** - the longer you lock, the more you get (up to 3x)
3. **Earn automatic rewards** from ALL marketplace fees - forever
4. **Claim anytime** without unstaking
5. **Get your tokens back** after the lock period ends

### For Marketplace Users
1. **Rent computing power, AI models, or digital assets** by the block
2. **Pay only for what you use** - transparent, fair pricing
3. **Resell unused time** on a secondary market if plans change
4. **Access premium resources** without huge upfront costs

## The Magic: Automatic Revenue Sharing

Every time someone uses the marketplace:
- **97.5%** goes to the resource owner (fair compensation)
- **2.5%** goes to a treasury that automatically distributes to ALL stakers

This means:
- ✅ **No token inflation** - rewards come from real revenue
- ✅ **No manual work** - everything happens automatically via smart contracts
- ✅ **Fair distribution** - your share matches your commitment (BlocTime balance)
- ✅ **Sustainable growth** - more marketplace activity = more rewards for everyone

## The Lock-Time Multiplier

Commitment is rewarded:

| Lock Duration | Multiplier | Example |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| 0 blocks (instant) | 1.0x | Stake 100 tokens → Get 100 BlocTime |
| 10,000 blocks (~1.5 days) | 1.5x | Stake 100 tokens → Get 150 BlocTime |
| 50,000 blocks (~1 week) | 2.0x | Stake 100 tokens → Get 200 BlocTime |
| 100,000 blocks (~2 weeks) | 3.0x | Stake 100 tokens → Get 300 BlocTime |

**More BlocTime = Bigger share of marketplace revenue**

## Real-World Example

Imagine:
- You stake **1,000 tokens** for **50,000 blocks** (1 week)
- You receive **2,000 BlocTime tokens** (2x multiplier)
- Total BlocTime in circulation: **100,000**
- Your share: **2%** of all marketplace revenue

If the marketplace generates **$10,000 in fees** this month:
- Treasury receives: **$10,000**
- Distribution pool (50%): **$5,000**
- **Your reward: $100** (2% of $5,000)

And this happens **every month**, as long as the marketplace is active!

## Why It Works

### The Virtuous Cycle
1. **Stakers lock tokens** → Reduces circulating supply → Increases scarcity
2. **Marketplace grows** → More fees collected → Bigger rewards
3. **Bigger rewards** → More people stake → More locked tokens
4. **More locked tokens** → Higher token value → Attracts more users
5. **More users** → Marketplace grows → **Cycle repeats**

### Built on Solid Foundations
- ✅ **Audited smart contracts** using OpenZeppelin standards
- ✅ **Battle-tested security** with reentrancy guards and safe math
- ✅ **Transparent on-chain** - every transaction is verifiable
- ✅ **No admin keys** for core functions - fully decentralized
- ✅ **Production-ready** - deployed and tested on Base network

## The Marketplace: What Can You Rent?

- **Computing Power**: GPU clusters, CPU nodes, storage
- **AI Models**: Language models, image generators, data processors
- **Digital Assets**: Software licenses, API access, premium content
- **Anything tokenizable** that can be rented by the block

### Fractional Rentals
Rented too much time? **List unused blocks for sale**:
- Rent 1000 blocks, use 600, sell the remaining 400
- Set your own price on the secondary market
- Buyers get instant access, you recover costs

## Who Benefits?

### 🏦 Token Holders
- Passive income from marketplace growth
- No active management required
- Rewards scale with commitment

### 💼 Resource Owners
- Monetize idle computing/assets
- Access global marketplace
- Automatic payments

### 👥 Renters
- Pay-per-use pricing
- No long-term contracts
- Resell unused time

### 🌍 The Ecosystem
- Sustainable tokenomics
- Aligned incentives
- Positive feedback loops

## Getting Started

### As a Staker
1. Get tokens (native token of the protocol)
2. Approve the staking contract
3. Choose your lock duration (longer = more BlocTime)
4. Stake and receive BlocTime tokens
5. Watch rewards accumulate automatically
6. Claim rewards anytime
7. Unstake after lock period

### As a Marketplace User
1. Browse available resources
2. Rent by the block (pay what you need)
3. Use the resource during your rental period
4. List unused time for resale (optional)
5. Repeat as needed

## The Numbers

- **Treasury Fee**: 2.5% (industry-leading low fee)
- **Distribution Rate**: 50% of treasury (configurable)
- **Max Multiplier**: 3.0x (for maximum commitment)
- **Min Multiplier**: 1.0x (instant access)
- **Security**: OpenZeppelin contracts, ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20

## Why BlocTime is Different

| Traditional Staking | BlocTime Protocol |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Rewards from inflation | Rewards from real revenue |
| Fixed APY | Dynamic, growth-based returns |
| Just lock tokens | Earn from ecosystem activity |
| Dilutes token value | Sustainable value creation |
| Centralized control | Decentralized smart contracts |

## The Vision

BlocTime creates a **self-sustaining economy** where:
- Stakers are rewarded for commitment
- Marketplace users get fair, flexible access
- Resource owners monetize their assets
- Everyone benefits from ecosystem growth

No gimmicks. No inflation. No manual intervention.

**Just elegant mathematics, robust engineering, and aligned incentives.**
