# Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the strategic integration priorities for model providers, compute infrastructure, and DeFi protocols to build a robust decentralized AI ecosystem.

## Model Providers
- **openrouter** (priority) - Multi-model API aggregator for flexible AI access
- **anthropic** - Claude models for advanced reasoning
- **openai** - GPT models for general-purpose tasks
- **chutes** - Specialized model deployment

## Compute Infrastructure
- **primeintellect** (priority) - Decentralized GPU compute network
- **akash** - Decentralized cloud computing marketplace
- **lium** (bittensor) - Incentivized machine learning network

## DeFi Integration

### Price Feeds
- **uniswap** (priority) - DEX liquidity and pricing data
- **raydium** (priority) - Solana-based AMM pricing
- **coingecko** (priority) - Comprehensive market data aggregator
- **coinmarketcap** (priority) - Industry-standard price tracking
- **binance** - CEX pricing and volume data

### Oracle Services
- **chainlink** - Decentralized oracle network for reliable data feeds
- **pyth** - High-frequency price oracle for DeFi

### Lending Protocols
- **aave** - Leading decentralized lending platform
- **gnosis** - Multi-sig and DAO treasury management

### Low-Risk Stablecoin Yield (1-10% ROI)
- **aave** - Stable yield through overcollateralized lending

## Implementation Strategy
1. Prioritize integrations marked as (priority)
2. Build modular connectors for each service
3. Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. Monitor performance and optimize based on usage patterns
